{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:test_betax} can be used to perform hypothesis tests on the causal effect (betax) parameter in Krauth (2016).  
The specific testing method used here is to "invert" the Imbens-Manski confidence interval.  That is we reject the null that betax equals 
some number at x% significance if and only if that number is not in the Imbens-Manski (100-x)% confidence interval.  This test inherits
the desirable properties of the Imbens-Manski confidence interval. 
{p_end}

{pstd}
{it: exp} can be any expression that evaluates to a number.

This command is a postestimation command for {help rcr}.

{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
{cmd:test_betax} stores the following in {cmd:r()}:

{synoptset 20 tabbed}{...}
{p2col 5 20 24 2: Scalars}{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(p)}}p-value of test{p_end}

{pstd}
There is no conventional test statistic since the test is constructed by inverting
the confidence interval.
